# In this tutorial, we learn how to subclass :any:`PtyScan` to make

# Again, the imports first.

# For this tutorial we assume that the data and meta information is
# in this path:
save_path = '/tmp/ptypy/sim/'

# Furthermore, we assume that a file about the experimental geometry is
# located at
geofilepath = save_path + 'geometry.txt'
print geofilepath
# and has contents of the following form
print ''.join([line for line in open(geofilepath, 'r')])

# The scanning positions are in
positionpath = save_path + 'positions.txt'
print positionpath

# with a list of positions for vertical and horizontanl movement and the
# image frame from the "camera"
print ''.join([line for line in open(positionpath, 'r')][:6])+'....'

# Writing a subclass
# ------------------

# A subclass of :any:`PtyScan` takes the same input parameter
# tree as PtyScan itself, i.e :py:data:`.scan.data`. As the subclass
# will most certainly require additional parameters, there has to be
# a flexible additional container. For PtyScan, that is the
# :py:data:`.scan.data.recipe` parameter. A subclass must extract all
# additional parameters from this source and, in script, you fill
# the recipe with the appropriate items.

# In this case we can assume that the only parameter of the recipe
# is the base path ``/tmp/ptypy/sim/``\ . Hence we write
RECIPE = u.Param()
RECIPE.base_path = '/tmp/ptypy/sim/'

# Now we import the default generic parameter set from
from ptypy.core.data import PtyScan
DEFAULT = PtyScan.DEFAULT.copy()

# This would be the perfect point to change any default value.
# For sure we need to set the recipe parameter
DEFAULT.recipe = RECIPE

# A default data file location may be handy too and we allow saving of
# data in a single file. And since we know it is simulated data we do not
# have to find the optical axes in the diffraction pattern with
# the help of auto_center
DEFAULT.dfile = '/tmp/ptypy/sim/npy.ptyd'
DEFAULT.auto_center = False

# Our defaults are now
print u.verbose.report(DEFAULT, noheader=True)

# The simplest subclass of PtyScan would look like this
class NumpyScan(PtyScan):
    # We overwrite the DEFAULT with the new DEFAULT.
    DEFAULT = DEFAULT

    def __init__(self, pars=None, **kwargs):
        # In init we need to call the parent.
        super(NumpyScan, self).__init__(pars, **kwargs)

# Of course this class does nothing special beyond PtyScan.

# An additional step of initialisation would be to retrieve
# the geometric information that we stored in ``geofilepath`` and update
# the input parameters with it.

# We write a tiny file parser.
def extract_geo(base_path):
    out = {}
    with open(base_path+'geometry.txt') as f:
        for line in f:
            key, value = line.strip().split()
            out[key] = eval(value)
    return out

# We test it.
print extract_geo(save_path)

# That seems to work. We can integrate this parser into
# the initialisation as we assume that this small access can be
# done by all MPI nodes without data access problems. Hence,
# our subclass becomes
class NumpyScan(PtyScan):
    # We overwrite the DEFAULT with the new DEFAULT.
    DEFAULT = DEFAULT

    def __init__(self, pars=None, **kwargs):
        p = DEFAULT.copy(depth=2)
        p.update(pars)

        with open(p.recipe.base_path+'geometry.txt') as f:
            for line in f:
                key, value = line.strip().split()
                # we only replace Nones or missing keys
                if p.get(key) is None:
                    p[key] = eval(value)

        super(NumpyScan, self).__init__(p, **kwargs)

# Good! Next, we need to implement how the class finds out about
# the positions in the scan. The method
# :py:meth:`~ptypy.core.data.PtyScan.load_positions` can be used
# for this purpose.
print PtyScan.load_positions.__doc__

# One nice thing about rewriting ``self.load_positions`` is that
# the maximum number of frames will be set and we do not need to
# manually adapt :py:meth:`~ptypy.core.data.PtyScan.check`

# The last step is to overwrite the actual loading of data.
# Loading happens (MPI-compatible) in
# :py:meth:`~ptypy.core.data.PtyScan.load`

# Load seems a bit more complex than ``self.load_positions`` for its
# return values. However, we can opt-out of providing weights (masks)
# and positions, as we have already adapted ``self.load_positions``
# and there were no bad pixels in the (linear) detector

# The final subclass looks like this.
class NumpyScan(PtyScan):
    # We overwrite the DEFAULT with the new DEFAULT.
