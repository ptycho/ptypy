Welcome Ptychonaut!
-------------------
     
|ptypy| [#pronounciation]_ [#ptypypaper]_ is a
framework for scientific ptychography compiled by 
P. Thibault and B. Enders and other authors (see AUTHORS).

It is the result of years of experience in the field of ptychography condensed
into a versatile python package. The package covers the whole path of
ptychographic analysis after the actual experiment is completed
- from data management to reconstruction to visualization.

The main idea of ptypy is: *"Flexibility and Scalabality through abstraction"*. 
Most often, you will find a class for every concept of ptychography in 
|ptypy|. Using these or other more abstract base classes, new ideas
may be developed in a rapid manner without the cumbersome overhead of 
data management, memory access or
distributed computing. Additionally, |ptypy|
provides a rich set of utilities and helper functions,
especially for input and output

To get started quickly, please find the official documentation on
`the project pages <http://ptycho.github.io/ptypy>`__
or have a look at the examples in the ``templates`` directory.

Features
--------

* **Difference Map** [#dm]_ algorithm engine with power bound constraint [#power]_.
* **Maximum Likelihood** [#ml]_ engine with preconditioners and regularizers.
* A few more engines (RAAR, sDR, ePIE, ...).

* **Fully parallelized** using the Massage Passing Interface
  (`MPI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_). 
  Simply execute your script with::
  
    $ mpiexec -n [nodes] python <your_ptypy_script>.py

* **GPU acceleration** based on custom kernels, CuPy or PyCUDA/reikna.
  See examples in ``templates/accelerate``, ``templates/engines/cupy`` and ``templates/engines/pycuda``.

* A **client-server** approach for visualization and control based on 
  `ZeroMQ <http://www.zeromq.org>`_ .
  The reconstruction may run on a remote hpc cluster while your desktop
  computer displays the reconstruction progress.

* **Mixed-state** reconstructions of probe and object [#states]_ for 
  overcoming partial coherence or related phenomena.
  
* **On-the-fly** reconstructions (while data is being acquired) using the
  the `PtyScan <http://http://ptycho.github.io/ptypy/rst/ptypy.core.html#ptypy.core.data.PtyScan>`_
  class in the `linking mode <http://ptycho.github.io/ptypy/rst/data_management.html#case-flyscan>`_


Installation
------------

Installation should be as simple as ::

   $ pip install .

or, as a user, ::

   $ pip install . --user


Dependencies
------------

Ptypy depends on standard python packages:
 * numpy
 * scipy
 * h5py
 * matplotlib & pillow (optional - required for plotting)
 * mpi4py (optional - required for parallel computing)
 * pyzmq (optional - required for the plotting client)
 
GPU support
-----------

We support an accelerated version of |ptypy| for CUDA-capable GPUs based on our own kernels and the
`CuPy <https://cupy.dev/>`_ package. We recommend to install the dependencies for this version like so.
::

    $ conda env create -f accelerate/cuda_cupy/dependencies.yml
    $ conda activate ptypy_cupy
    (ptypy_cupy)$ pip install .
