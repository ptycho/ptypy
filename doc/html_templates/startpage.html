<p>Ptypy (pronounced typy, forget the p, as in ptychography or psychology) is a
reconstruction package for ptychographic datasets.</p>

<p>To get started quickly, look at the examples in the template directory. You will
also need to prepare your data in a hdf5 file and following a structure that
ptypy can understand. Ptypy provides already routines to prepare data from three
beamlines (cSAXS, PSI; I13, Diamond; and I22, ESRF) and more will come.</p>

<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<p>Ptypy was designed with flexibility in mind: it should allow rapid development
of new ideas. To this end, much of the "ugly" details have been hidden in
advanced containers that manage data and access "views" onto them. </p>

<p>Currently implemented:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dully parallelized (using MPI)</li>
<li>Difference map algorithm with power bound constraint</li>
<li>Maximum Likelihood with preconditioners and regularizers.</li>
<li>Mixed-state reconstructions of probe and object</li>
<li>Multiple-wavelength reconstruction</li>
<li>On-the-fly reconstructions (while data is being acquired) </li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>Installation should be as simple as
    sudo python setup.py install
or, as a user,
    python setup.py install --user</p>

<h2>
<a name="dependencies" class="anchor" href="#dependencies"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Dependencies</h2>

<p>Ptypy depends on standard python packages:</p>

<ul>
<li>numpy</li>
<li>scipy</li>
<li>matplotlib</li>
<li>h5py</li>
<li>mpi4py (optional - required for parallel computing)</li>
<li>zeromq (optional - required for the offline plotting client)</li>
<li>maybe some more we forgot to put in this list.</li>
</ul>
