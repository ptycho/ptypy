In this directory you will find the files to automatically generate the ptypy documentation.

to generate the documentation, just enter

make <sort>

where <sort> can be html, epub, pdf.
The resulting documentation is then put in the build directory.

The source files are in the source directory. Please feel free to modify, improve the files.
The main source file is source/index.rst   It calls other .rst files to generate the documentation.

BEWARE that the documentation is generated from the .py files present in the python path directory, ie from the 
installed files on the system, and not from the local files. So if by default python looks first at the system 
installed ptypy library, you have to re-install first ptypy in order for the modification to appear in the 
documentation. This does not hold of course for the local .rst files used to generate the structure of the
documentation.

the source/conf.py file contains the basic parameters of the documentation generator.

Note that you can use reStructuredText commands inside the docstring as well, they will be further interepreted
by sphinx (but not in the plain line python help of course).

If you don't like the look of the documentation, you can change in conf.py the html_theme option. You can choose from
basic, default, sphinxdoc, scrolls, agogo, nature, haiku, traditional and epub.

For questions, please feel free to contact Bjoern.
